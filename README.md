# Equity Language

Equity is a priority in the City of Los Angeles and we want to improve the language used in websites to be more inclusive (of all communities) while also educating the public about exclusionary language.

Our goal is to help make content on the web more inclusive towards all genders, LGBTQ+ people, and more.

## Project

We are creating a web tool that searches websites for gender/LGBTQ-exclusive or problematic words and suggests more inclusive words. For example, you can search for the gender-exclusive word "fireman", and the tool will find it, and suggest the gender-inclusive word "firefighter".


### How to contribute

We welcome help and constructive criticism. Here are some ways to parcipated.

* Join the team at Hack For LA. ~~We meet on Tuesday evenings downtown~~ Due to covid-19, we meet Wednesdays at 7pm PT on Zoom, and we keep in touch during the week via remote tools like Slack and Zoom.

* Share your opinion about what words you want to search. We are currently experimenting with words on this [list](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/gender-inclusive-language), and we anticipate that many people may want to create their own lists of words.


### Context

Here are gender inclusive language words I’ve used with other projects:

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) on gender

This section is thanks to [United Nations Population Fund](https://www.unfpa.org/resources/frequently-asked-questions-about-gender-equality)


### What is gender?

The term gender refers to the economic, social and cultural attributes and opportunities associated with being male, female, transgender, etc. Many societies have different expectations about how people of different genders should dress, behave, work, love, marry, raise families, and participate in the society and its culture. Re


### How is gender different from sex?

Gender differs from sex in that gender is social and cultural in nature, and sex is biological. Gender attributes and characteristics, encompassing, inter alia, the roles that people of different genders play, and the expectations placed upon the people, vary widely among societies and change over time. But the fact that gender attributes are socially constructed means that they are also amenable to change in ways that can make a society more just and equitable.


### What is gender equity?

Gender equity is the process of being fair to all people, regardless of gender, such as male, female, transgender, agender, etc. Gender equity is linked to sustainable development and is vital to the realization of human rights for all. The overall objective of gender equity is a society in which all people enjoy the same opportunities, rights, and obligations, in all spheres of life, regardless of gender.
